 # *Oma Helsinki* - Business College school project.
  
 ## The purpose of the app is to fetch data from MyHelsinki API and shows places of interests nearby, along with activities and events.
 #### The app is built with Angular for UI and the back-end is developed with Spring Boot.
 #### Our team consisted of four students of Business College Helsinki: Janna, Mika, Evgeniia and me, Josephine.
